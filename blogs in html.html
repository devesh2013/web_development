    <p>If your child is heading into first grade, you might be wondering: What school supplies do I need for 1st grade?
        From
        waterproof backpacks to the right reading books, we’ve got you covered with a smart, parent-friendly checklist
        to help
        you feel confident, organized, and ready for the year ahead.

        First, Know What to Expect in 1st Grade
        First grade is when foundational skills really start to take shape. Your child will be diving into more
        structured
        reading and writing, building basic math fluency, and gaining more independence.

        Here are a few first grade expectations you can generally count on:

        Reading short stories and beginning chapter books
        Learning to write full sentences and simple paragraphs
        Exploring addition and subtraction within 20
        Building skills in science, social studies, and art
        Participating in group work and developing social-emotional skills
        Being ready for first grade isn’t just about academics — it’s also about showing up organized, focused, and
        prepared
        with the right tools.</p>

    <h2>The Ultimate 1st Grade School Supply List</h2>
    <p>Here’s a solid baseline of first grade supplies most schools request:

        Backpack (preferably waterproof) – Look for something lightweight but roomy enough to carry folders, books, and
        lunch. A
        waterproof backpack is ideal for unpredictable weather and water bottle spills.
        Lunchbox + water bottle – A leak-proof, easy-to-clean set is a must.
        Labeled folders – One for homework, one for classwork, and maybe one for “keep at home” papers.
        Composition notebooks or primary-ruled notebooks – These are ideal for early writing and journaling.
        #2 pencils + erasers – Go with pre-sharpened packs if possible (your kid’s teacher will thank you).
        Crayons, markers, and colored pencils – A small set of each goes a long way for art projects and classroom work.
        Glue sticks and child-safe scissors – Essential for hands-on activities.
        Dry erase markers – Often used for group work and whiteboard practice.
        Pencil case – Keeps things from getting lost in the backpack jungle.
        Headphones or earbuds (with a case!) – Some schools require these for computer lab time or tablet use.
        TIP: If your child loves to draw so much that they never leave space for practicing their writing, consider
        getting them
        the Doodle-Friendly Notebook. We specially designed this composition notebook to include extra spaces for
        doodling!</p>

        <h2>Should I Label My Kid’s School Supplies?</h2>
        <p>Short answer: YES.
        
        Labeling your child’s supplies helps prevent confusion, mix-ups, and lost items. You don’t have to go overboard — a
        simple waterproof name label or even permanent marker initials will do the trick.
        
        Especially for things like water bottles, headphones, lunchboxes, and jackets, labeling is one of those small steps that
        can save a lot of headaches later</p>
